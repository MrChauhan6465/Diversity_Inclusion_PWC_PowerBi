# Diversity & Inclusion Project: Advancing Gender Balance in Executive Leadership
Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Diversity & Inclusion project from my virtual internship at PwC Switzerland. This project is centered around advancing gender balance in the executive leadership of a prominent telecom client. I've utilized Power BI to create meaningful Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualize gender diversity insights.

## Project Overview
In a world where diversity and inclusion are imperative for success, this project aims to address gender imbalances in executive roles. The telecom client's HR team is dedicated to fostering diversity, yet challenges persist in achieving gender parity at the leadership level. My task was to create impactful KPIs and insights to drive inclusivity.

## Key Objectives
Define and visualize KPIs for hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover using Power BI.
Conduct a root cause analysis to identify barriers to gender balance.
Provide strategic recommendations based on data-driven insights.

## Project Highlights
KPI Visualization: I meticulously crafted a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visually represents gender diversity metrics, enabling a clear understanding of the current landscape.
Root Cause Analysis: Delving deep into underlying factors affecting progress, including diversity awareness, unconscious biases, and outdated recruitment strategies.
Outcome: The project culminated in an insightful dashboard that sheds light on gender dynamics, paving the way for strategic decisions to achieve a more balanced executive leadership.
